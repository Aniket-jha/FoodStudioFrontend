Food Studio Customer Agreement
</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
This Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legal agreement between you and Supply Links (the sole owner of its brand "Food Studio") that states the terms and conditions under which you may receive the Food Studio Service and use the Food Studio Web site ("Food Studio.co.in"). If you use the Food Studio or Food Studio.co.in, you agree to these terms and conditions.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Food Studio Service:</strong> The Food Studio Service is a transaction, information and communication service available to authorized users ("customers") who access Food Studio.co.in. Food Studio.co.in currently provides an online dry fruits & nuts shopping and delivery service, and may in the future provide additional shopping and related services. Food Studio's employees, agents or designees will shop and deliver dry fruits and nuts orders placed with the Food Studio Service. Prices of products sold online may differ from those in retail stores. Delivery will be made to the delivery address that you specify when you confirm your order. Prices for products you place in your cart will be guaranteed for the transaction. Payment for dry fruits and nuts, and associated shopping and delivery fees is due in advance or at the time of delivery. You are responsible for ensuring that someone is present at the delivery address to receive and pay for deliveries at the specified time of delivery. Anyone at the delivery address who receives the delivery is conclusively presumed to be authorized to receive and pay for the order. If Food Studio.co.in cannot deliver your order, or must make an additional delivery because no one is at the delivery address to receive and pay for the order at the specified time, or wrong address / details given to us by you, will be assessed an additional fee. If you are not satisfied for any reason with an item purchased through the Food Studio Service, you may call customer service at the time of receiving your order at +91 992 005 0123. Food Studio.co.in's liability for missing a delivery is limited onlyto delivery at a later agreed time at no additional charge.
<br/><br/>
<strong>

Although prices of most of the products do not fluctuate on a daily basis, changes in pricing would be updated almost immediately on the portal.
<strong>
<br/><br/>
Cancellation Policy:</strong> As a policy, we do not cancel any order after it is placed on the portal. However, if you need to add more products, you need to call us on customer care number +91 992 005 0123. Please note: If we suspect any fraudulent transaction by any customer or any transaction which defies the terms & conditions of using the website, we at our sole discretion could cancel such orders. We will maintain a negative list of all fraudulent transactions and customers and would deny access to them or cancel any orders placed by them.
<strong>
<br/><br/>
Return & Refunds:</strong> We have a "no questions asked return and refund policy" which entitles all our members to return the product at the time of delivery if due to some reason they are not satisfied with the product. We will take the returned product back with us and make the necessary adjustments to your order value. However, please note: If a product is returned due to a change in mind and your order value goes below our minimum order requirement, you will be assessed an additional delivery fee. If the seal of the packaged item has been broken or tampered with it shall not be eligible for returns or refunds.
